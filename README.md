# MedivalGame
A project where i set out to "combine" Kingdom Come Delieverence and Mordhau's combat system. Meaning that the player locks onto one character at a time and the attacks are omnidirectional. This also comes with features like the clashes and morphing and some other features that would set this apart from other similar projects
